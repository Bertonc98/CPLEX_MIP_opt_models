In order to compile the two models:

- Move to exe directory
- Execute "./maker basic_model/strong_model", this will compile the model file
- Execute the model as: "basicmodel/strong_model instance d k"
  Where instance is the toy instance number, d and k as defined in the model
  
The basic model output comprehend the comparison between the provided results and the computed ones on the bash
The strong model does not solve any instance (infeasible)
